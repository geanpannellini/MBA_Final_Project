## Abstract

> In response to the escalating data consumption in businesses, new data storage solutions are emerging with a focus on speed and efficiency. This has led to a reevaluation of traditional data modeling concepts proposed by Inmon and Kimball, which have been prevalent since the early 20th century. The advent of high-performance technologies questions the necessity of these models in achieving efficient data pipelines. This study aims to analyze data query performance in two scenarios: querying from normalized tables and querying directly from non-normalized tables, both utilizing parquet files as the data source. The dataset was sourced from an online rental company via the "Kaggle" platform. The comparison of results from both scenarios provides insights into the cost and performance implications of adopting modern storage approaches.
