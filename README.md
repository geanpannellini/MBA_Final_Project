# Performance of different data modeling approaches in modern storage architecture.
## Abstract

> To address a scenario of significant increases in data usage by companies, new data
storage tools are emerging focusing on speed and efficiency. Consequently, concepts from
Inmon and Kimball regarding data modeling, dating back to the early 20th century and still
widely applied today, become points of questioning. This is because the performance of
these new technologies can lead to more performant data pipeline queries without the
specific need for modeling. Therefore, the present study aims to analyze the behavior of a
data query using two scenarios: the first one sourcing queries from normalized tables, and
the other scenario querying directly from a non-normalized table, both using parquet files as
the source. The dataset was obtained from an online rental company through the "Kaggle"
platform. With the results obtained from both scenarios, it was possible to compare and
understand the impact on costs and performance of data teams when using a new storage
approach.
